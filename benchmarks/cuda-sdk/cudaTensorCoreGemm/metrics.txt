	Domain domain_a:
                active_cycles_pm:  Number of cycles a multiprocessor has at least one active warp.

                 active_warps_pm:  Accumulated number of active warps per cycle. For every cycle it increments by the number of active warps in the cycle which can be in the range 0 to 64.

          shared_ld_transactions:  Number of transactions for shared load accesses. Maximum transaction size in volta is 128 bytes, any warp accessing more than 128 bytes will cause multiple transactions for a shared load instruction. This also includes extra transactions caused by shared bank conflicts.

Maximum transaction size in volta is 128 bytes, any warp accessing more than 128 bytes will cause multiple transactions for a shared store instruction. This also includes extra transactions caused by shared bank conflicts.
