====== Postprocessing Scripts ======

=== One-time Setup ===

1. Create Python virtual environment to avoid library conflicts

```
python3 -m venv data-env
```

2. Activate the virtual environment

```
source data-env/bin/activate
```

3. Install packages

```
pip3 install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose
```

=== Using the scripts ===

Activate the virtual environment before running the scripts if the environment is deactivated.

```
source data-env/bin/activate
```

One caveat is Parboil benchmarks cannot be compiled/cleaned when the virtual environment (Python3)is activated. To deactivate the virtual environment, run

``` 
deactivate
```

=== What are the scripts? ===
