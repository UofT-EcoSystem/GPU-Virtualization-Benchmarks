Steady State Predictor:

Eliminating the -1 in some final predictions:

- try and use the latest state for both?

by iterating until we obtain prediction for both, we are introducing a potential problem with qos of the longer app:
its QOS loss will be underestimated.


When two apps have a very large difference in the number of kernels, the estimate is failing (likely because of the
point above)


If one finished the runtime -> can directly estimate the other one


shorter one always estimates properly
